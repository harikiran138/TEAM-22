# PART 2 — 🧠 HOW THE AGENT WORKS (MACRO → MICRO)
Macro Flow (System Level)
Signal → Feature → Model → Insight → Agent Action → Feedback

Every 30 seconds:

Collect micro-behavior

Normalize per learner

Update cognitive state

Predict risk & mastery

Decide whether to act

Learn from outcome

Micro-Level Reasoning Example
Scenario: Student pauses frequently

❌ LMS interpretation:

“Student inactive”

✅ Lumina Analytics Agent:

Pause occurs at high-difficulty concept

Scroll depth is consistent

Error diversity is low
→ Productive struggle, NOT disengagement

Action:

Do nothing

Allow learning to continue

Increase mastery confidence window

# PART 3 — ⚙️ OPTIMIZATION OF AGENTIC ANALYTICS
1️⃣ Signal Optimization

Normalize signals per student

Weight signals by reliability

Filter idle noise

2️⃣ Feature Optimization

Replace raw time with:

Pause-at-difficulty index

Reattempt latency

Error-type entropy

3️⃣ Model Optimization

Hybrid modeling (XGBoost + DKT + BKT + GNN)

Continual learning with drift detection

SHAP-based explainability

4️⃣ Agent Optimization

Reward = learning gain, not engagement

Cooldowns for MCP messages

Cross-agent confirmation
