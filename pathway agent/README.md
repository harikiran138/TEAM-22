# Lumina – Pathway Agent

> **The Pathway Agent is Lumina’s policy engine that continuously selects the learner’s next best action by optimizing long-term mastery, engagement, and retention using shared context and reinforcement learning.**

## 🎯 Objective
Build the **Pathway Agent**, the central decision-making intelligence of Lumina, responsible for **continuously selecting the learner’s next best action** (continue, review, advance, rest) by optimizing **learning efficiency, engagement, and retention** using shared context and policy optimization.

## 📌 Scope
This project covers:
* Agent responsibilities and boundaries
* Input/output contracts
* Decision logic
* Reinforcement learning policy
* Optimization strategy
* Integration with other agents
* Explainability and auditability
